Londiste
========

Londiste is PgQ-based logical replication for PostgreSQL.

Forked from: https://github.com/pgq/londiste

Contains several customizations needed in our project:

- customizable column mapping
- row-level event filtering 
- remote rest-like slave
- saving batch content to disk
- tick skipping

Some of them could possibly be merged back to the original repo.
